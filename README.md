# Open TTR Launcher
A .NET GUI launcher for Toontown Rewritten.

## Installing
You must have a recent version of Visual Studio 19 installed in order to build the project solution.  

After downloading the repository, build the project in Visual Studio with the hotkey F7.  After that `OpenTTRLauncher.exe` should be found in `\src\bin\Debug`, and should run the program.

## Running the project
The launcher operates very simularlly to Toontown Rewritten's offical launcher.  2 entry fields for username and password are present, with the ability to login using either the login button or pressing the Enter key.

## Contact
I can be contacted via the following methods:
* Email: `christianmigueldiaz@gmail.com`
* Discord: `chrisd149#7640`

I will try my best to respond to legitimate questions/inquires at soon as possible, however it may take me a few days at 
most.
